# 🛡️ Bastion Host: Secure Access Gateway for Private Networks

---

## 📖 Overview

A **Bastion Host** (aka Jump Server) is a hardened server designed to provide **secure access** to private network resources that are otherwise inaccessible from the public internet. It acts as a controlled entry point to your internal infrastructure, reducing attack surfaces and improving auditability.

---

## 🔑 Key Benefits

* 🔐 **Enhanced Security**: Limits SSH/RDP access to private servers by forcing all access through a single, monitored host.
* 📜 **Centralized Logging**: Captures all access logs in one place for compliance and forensic analysis.
* 🔄 **Simplified Network Management**: Minimizes open firewall rules by exposing only the bastion host publicly.
* 🛠️ **Access Control**: Easily enforce multi-factor authentication and granular permissions.

## ⚙️ How it Works

1. **Public Subnet Bastion Host**:
   Deployed in a subnet with a public IP and internet access. It serves as the sole access point for administrators.

2. **Private Subnet Application Servers**:
   These servers have no direct internet access, ensuring they are insulated from external threats.

3. **Connection Flow**:

   * Admin SSHs to the Bastion Host.
   * From the Bastion Host, admin SSHs into private servers.

## 🛠️ Example: AWS Bastion Host Setup

### Step 1: Configure Security Groups

* **Bastion Host SG**: Allow SSH (port 22) only from trusted IPs.
* **Private Servers SG**: Allow SSH only from Bastion Host SG.

### Step 2: Launch Bastion Host Instance

```bash
aws ec2 run-instances \
  --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
  --count 1 \
  --instance-type t3.micro \
  --key-name MyKeyPair \
  --security-group-ids sg-bastion12345 \
  --subnet-id subnet-public12345 \
  --associate-public-ip-address
```

### Step 3: Connect via Bastion Host

```bash
ssh -i MyKeyPair.pem ec2-user@<bastion-host-public-ip>
ssh -i MyKeyPair.pem ec2-user@<private-instance-private-ip>
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

* 🛡️ **Harden the Bastion Host**: Regular updates, minimal software, restricted permissions.
* 🔐 **Use MFA and IAM policies** for access management.
* 📊 **Enable detailed monitoring and logging** (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs).
* 🚫 **Disable direct SSH access** to private servers from the internet.
* 🧩 **Consider AWS Systems Manager Session Manager** as a modern alternative to SSH bastion hosts.
